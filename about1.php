                                                from the corona virus but its major side effects i.e poverty,
                                                unemployment and the most important starvation. Many migrants have left
                                                their job and are helplessly forced to live inside home.
                                                But hunger doesn’t know any boundation. It forces people to come out of
                                                their home and earn their food, this results in even more increase in
                                                the number of cases. Not only,
                                                the problem is with lower poor people, but the same problem of food is
                                                with the family who are suffering from the coronavirus disease.
                                                They can’t get out to buy ration or even can’t cook because of sickness.

                                                So, the only solution here is to help them with food. Providing
                                                sanitized
                                                food packets to people in need.

                                                like a wedding ceremony with a large number of people. But due to this
                                                covid situation, people are not supposed to gather at a place and this
                                                results in wastage of food in bulk. The best solution to this problem is
                                                DONATION. On one hand where donating food will fill many tummies and

                                                will be the joy of sharing and receiving true blessings.
