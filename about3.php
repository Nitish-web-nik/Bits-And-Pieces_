                                                Covid 19 has not only disturbed human life but also worsened the
                                                condition of stray animals.
                                                We are forced to be indoor to maintain distance from the invisible virus
                                                but the four footed strays are left to suffer from extreme diseases.
                                                From the past 2 years, we locked ourself in the safety of our home but
                                                who cares about the pity poor animals. Studies show that Friendicoes,
                                                one of Delhi's largest animal hospital-cum-shelter, has been
                                                experiencing an influx of animals with worse conditions than usual. Many
                                                more cases like this have been reported from past years.<br><br>

                                                Mainly street animals feed themselves from the leftovers of restaurants,
                                                households, parties or from other eateries where there is huge wastage
                                                of food items. Lockdown made them strive because of hunger. Also many
                                                NGOs who are supposed to take care of this are out of funds and focusing
                                                on other necessary activities. According to Dr Anindita Bhadra, who
                                                heads a Dog Lab at IISER-Kolkata, “Dogs who do not have dedicated
                                                feeders suffer because even production of garbage from eateries has
                                                stopped and meat shops which were their favorite place to hover around
                                                have shut.” Pointing to the current scenario she added, “Once the
                                                lockdown is lifted the dog-human conflict will possibly increase.”

                                                We take this duty in our hand to feed those poor creatures as much as
